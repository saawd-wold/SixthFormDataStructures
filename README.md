# My Data Structures

## The Purpose of this project

My teacher made me write this Python library that aims to provide several data structures such as Lists, Queues, Stacks, Graphs, Trees, Hash-Sets and Hash-Maps.

I need to know these for the sake of A-Level Computer Science...

There are also a few that I don't "need" to know but because Computer Science is my favourite subject I will put in a little extra effort to also write the code for Doubly-Linked Lists, Array Lists, Deques, Tree Maps, Heaps and Vectors. 

## The structure of this project
This project provides a Python library called `DanielsDataStructures`. You can install it by using:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/saawd-wold/SixthFormDataStructures.git
```

Each folder here provides a family of data structures implementing one abstract data structure. Queues are found in the `queues` folder. The *abstract class* provided in `queues/Queue.py` specifies the methods any class implementing queues needs to provide, in this example these are `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty` and `isFull`.
